                        The selling price depends on market conditions, your car's condition, and how you present it. Private sales typically achieve higher prices than part-exchange or selling to dealers. To maximize your sale price: ensure your car is clean and well-presented, provide full service history, be honest about any issues, take high-quality photos, write a detailed and accurate description, and price competitively based on our valuation tool and similar listings.

                        You cannot legally sell a car with outstanding finance until the loan is fully paid off, as the finance company technically owns the vehicle until then. However, you have options: pay off the finance before selling, use the sale proceeds to settle the finance (the buyer pays the finance company directly), or work with dealers who can handle the finance settlement as part of the purchase. Always be transparent with potential buyers about any outstanding finance and ensure it's cleared before transferring ownership.
